# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am interested in enhancing the capabilities of image generation models on info-seeking (world knowledge) queries. Some research questions I am exploring include (1) utilizing search signals during the pre/post-training phases as well as during inference for image generation, and (2) enhancing the factual accuracy of images produced in response to info-seeking queries.

I am a research scientist at Google Deepmind. Prior to that, I received my Ph. D. from <a href = "https://www.cs.utexas.edu/">UTCS</a> advised by <a href = "https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/">Raymond J. Mooney.</a>
 I received my BEng. degree from <a href = "http://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/"> the Department of Automation</a> supervised by <a href = "http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/xiangyangji.html"> Prof. Xiangyang Ji</a> at <a href = "http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/then/index.html"> Tsinghua University</a> in 2017. 

My most recent research interests are in enhancing the capabilities of image generation models on info-seeking (world knowledge) queries. I work on (1) utilizing search signals during the pre/post-training phases as well as during inference for image generation, and (2) enhancing the factual accuracy of images produced in response to info-seeking queries.
