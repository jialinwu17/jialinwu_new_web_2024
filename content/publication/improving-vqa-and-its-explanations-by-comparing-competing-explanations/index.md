abstract: Most recent state-of-the-art Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems
  are opaque black boxes that are only trained to fit the answer distribution
  given the question and visual content. As a result, these systems frequently
  take shortcuts, focusing on simple visual concepts or question priors. This
  phenomenon becomes more problematic as the questions become complex that
  requires more reasoning and commonsense knowledge. To address this issue, we
  present a novel framework that uses explanations for competing answers to help
  VQA systems select the correct answer. By training on human textual
  explanations, our framework builds better representations for the questions
  and visual content, and then reweights confidences in the answer candidates
  using either generated or retrieved explanations from the training set. We
  evaluate our framework on the VQA-X dataset, which has more difficult
  questions with human explanations, achieving new state-of-the-art results on
  both VQA and its explanations.
