abstract: AI systems' ability to explain their reasoning is critical to their
  utility and trustworthiness. Deep neural networks have enabled significant
  progress on many challenging problems such as visual question answering (VQA).
  However, most of them are opaque black boxes with limited explanatory
  capability. This paper presents a novel approach to developing a
  high-performing VQA system that can elucidate its answers with integrated
  textual and visual explanations that faithfully reflect important aspects of
  its underlying reasoning while capturing the style of comprehensible human
  explanations. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the advantages of
  this approach compared to competing methods with both automatic evaluation
  metrics and human evaluation metrics.
