abstract: Daily scenes are complex in the real world due to occlusion, undesired
  lighting conditions, etc. Although humans handle those complicated
  environments well, they evoke challenges for machine learning systems to
  identify and describe the target without ambiguity. Most previous research
  focuses on mining discriminating features within the same category for the
  target object. One the other hand, as the scene becomes more complicated,
  human frequently uses the neighbor objects as complementary information to
  describe the target one. Motivated by that, we propose a novel Complementary
  Neighboring-based Attention Network (CoNAN) that explicitly utilizes the
  visual differences between the target object and its highly-related neighbors.
  These highly-related neighbors are determined by an attentional ranking
  module, as complementary features, highlighting the discriminating aspects for
  the target object. The speaker module then takes the visual difference
  features as an additional input to generate the expression. Our qualitative
  and quantitative results on the dataset RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
  demonstrate that our generated expressions outperform other state-of-the-art
  models by a clear margin.
